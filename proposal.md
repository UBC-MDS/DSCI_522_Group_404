# Project Proposal

## Data
We are interested in some topics about flight delay so we found a dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays#flights.csv. This dataset contains some information about the number of on-time, delayed, canceled flights of 2015 in USA. However, since this dataset is a bit too big, we are going to remove the irrelevant columns like YEAR, DAY, DAY_OF_WEEK,.etc.


## Research question

Our main inferential research question is *“What’s the relationship between flight distance and flight delayed time.”* If time allowed, we will also work on a subquestion which is still to be decided.

## Our plan
We plan to fit a linear model on the dataset to find if there is signigificant linear relationship between those two variables by conducting a hypothesis test and how is their relationship by contucting a Generalized Linear Model. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Before fit the data to any model, we will use scatter plot to see how the data points are distributed and diagnose any association. Then we can fit it into a model.


## Results
The summary of lm() can show some results of the estimates of linear model parameters and predictions of the response. The plot of the Generalized Linear Model will help visualize a relationship.
