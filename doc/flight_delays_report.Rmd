## Requirements for report script

An .Rmd or .ipynb files that presents the key useful (not all!) exploratory data analysis as well as the statistical summaries and figures in a little report. There should be a written narrative in this document that introduces and justifies your question, introduces the data set, presents the findings/results, and interprets the findings/results in context of the question. Some critique of the analysis is also expected (limitations, assumptions, etc) and a statement of future directions (what would you do next if you had more time to work on this). The report is expected to be 1-2 written pages (excluding figures, tables and references). You are expected to have a reference section and cite 2-3 external sources (data source can be one of these citations) in addition to citing the programming languages and packages used. Yes, you need to cite the programming languages and packages used in your project. You will learn how to do this in lecture.





```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
