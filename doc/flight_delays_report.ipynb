    "\n",
    "In this project we aim to develop a classifier which predicts whether a US domestic flight will be delayed based on its characteristics, comparing the performance of Support Vector Machines (\"SVM\"), Logistic Regression and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (\"LGBM\") classifiers. After optimizing for hyperparameters, the SVM resulted in a {{acc_svc}}% accuracy rate. In comparison, the Logistic Regression classifier achieved a {{acc_lgr}}%. Lastly, the LGBM model only achieved a test accuracy of {{acc_lgbm}}%. Comparing the results from the three modelsComparing the results from the three models, ot appears that neither model does a good job of classifying delayed flights, even after parameter optimization. A second look at the features and the consideration of different classifiers may therefore be required.\n",

    "\n",
    "On any given day there are approximately 87,000 flights in the skies of the United States (US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). For business travellers trying to fit productivity into every hour of the day, knowing whether a flight will be delayed would help them avoid setting unrealistic meeting times. Here we endeavour to test whether a machine learning model can answer the question of whether a flight will be delayed. "

    "For this project, we selected US Deparment of Transportation's dataset on [2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays#flights.csv.). This data is shared on Kaggle under a CC0: Public Domain license.   This dataset contains data for approximately 6 million domestic flights in the 2015 calender year with datetime-, airline- and flight-related features. Some datetime-related features include `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `DAY_OF_THE_WEEK`, `SCHEDULED_DEPARTURE`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `DEPARTURE_DELAY`, and  `ARRIVAL_TIME`. Some examples of the airline-related features are `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, and `TAIL_NUMBER`. Lastly,  the flight-related features include features such as `ORIGIN_AIRPORT`, `DESTINATION_AIRPORT`, `DISTANCE`, `SCHEDULED_TIME`, `ELAPSED_TIME`,  and `AIR_TIME`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a preliminary look at the data, we observe average departure delay for different US domestic carriers. Here we observe that Spirit Airways and United Airways experiences the largest average departure delays in 2015. Similarly, Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines recorded the lowest average departure delay times in the country for the same year. Our analysis will explore whether this feature has any predictive power.\n",

    "## Results, Critiques & Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our original research question is a classification problem of predicting which flights are likely to be delayed. The motivation for this study is to help business travel passengers in making plans when they travel on the amount of buffer time they should keep in their schedules when travelling before making meeting commitments.\n",
    "\n",
    "From EDA, we noticed that our dataset is unbalanced. Therefore, we'll be relying heavily on metrics such as the f1 score, precision and recall to determine whether the model is capable of predicting whether or not a flight would be delayed or not. Using sklearn's classification report, we observe that LGBM performs best, followed by SVM then logistic regression models yield identical results. More specifically we observe that the logistic regression model does not predict any delayed flights as seen from the f1 score for the delayed group being zero. The LGBM Classifier was able to capture predictions for the delayed flights, but the f1 score, recall and precision are all horribly low.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of precision and recall score the LGBM Classifier out performs the SVM Classifier. In the LGBM Classifier we were able to achieve a precision of roughly 60%, which means that roughly 60% of our results are actually relevant. However, LGBM's recall score of aprroximately 60% means that less that 0% of actually relevant results are correctly predicted by our model. With these abysmal performance, we have a lot of room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "One critique of our anaylsis is our choice to reduce the number of examples in our dataset. Our original database is huge with roughly 6 million examples and 40 features. We wanted to reduce the size of the dataset, so it'll be faster to perform wrangling, EDA and modeling. This is the reason why we reduced the training and validation dataset to only include 8000 examples each. We believe with more training examples, our model might've gotten a better score.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we believe the biggest flaw in our analysis is our method of selecting features. We selected our features based partly on convenience and on \"intuition\". We wanted to only keep a few features (below 5) in order to keep the size of our training and predicting dataset small, so we eliminated a lot of the potential features. The features that we used were only kept based on our limited knowledge of airline travel. We thought features such as DISTANCE, MONTH and etc. were important. We didn't think of performing any correlation analysis on our features, nor utilize any feature selection techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination or Search and Score Methods.\n",
